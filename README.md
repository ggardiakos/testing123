## Introduction

This project is a robust NestJS backend designed for seamless integration with Shopify. It provides a powerful API for managing Shopify resources such as products, orders, and collections. Built with scalability and performance in mind, it leverages Mikro-ORM for efficient database management, Redis for lightning-fast caching, and BullMQ for reliable background job processing.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Get up and running in minutes:

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Shopify API credentials and database info
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run start:dev
   ```

4. **Test Shopify Connection**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/shopify/products
   # Should return a list of products from your Shopify store
   ```

5. **Explore API Documentation**
   Open `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` in your browser to see available endpoints.

📘 **Pro Tip:** Use `pnpm run start:debug` for debugging with VSCode.

🔧 **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter any issues, check our [Common Issues](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - A progressive Node.js framework
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Advanced open-source database
- [Mikro-ORM](https://mikro-orm.io/) - TypeScript ORM for Node.js
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - In-memory data structure store
- [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) - Queue management for Node.js
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - Monitoring and alerting toolkit
- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) - Universal logging library
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) - Error tracking and performance monitoring

## 🛠️ Error Handling

The application implements consistent error handling across all services:

- **Custom Exception Filters**: To centralize error responses and standardize error structures.
- **Sentry**: For logging and tracking errors in production environments.
- **Detailed Error Logging**: Through Winston to ensure errors are logged with useful context.

Ensure to follow this structure when adding new features to maintain consistency in error handling.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Shopify Partner Account
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-shopify-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   pnpm mikro-orm migration:up
   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
pnpm run start:dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

The project has several built-in security features:

- **CORS**: Configured with controlled origins for enhanced security.
- **Helmet**: Adds several HTTP headers to secure the app.
- **Rate Limiting**: Managed through @nestjs/throttler to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

Best Practices for Production:
- Always use HTTPS.
- Rotate and store sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys) using services like AWS Secrets Manager.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs using ValidationPipe and Joi.

## ⚙️ Scalability Considerations

The app is designed with scalability in mind. Here are some tips for optimizing performance under high loads:

- **Cluster Mode**: Run the app in cluster mode to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. Use the built-in NestJS clustering or PM2.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Redis and PostgreSQL should be configured for horizontal scaling to handle increasing load.
- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers (e.g., NGINX) to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- **Caching**: Ensure frequently accessed data is cached using Redis to reduce load on the database.

## 📈 Monitoring & Alerts

- **Datadog**: Configured for monitoring application performance, including metrics like request throughput and latency.
- **AWS X-Ray**: Integrated for tracing requests to understand the flow of data and detect bottlenecks.
- **Sentry**: Captures and tracks errors across environments, providing detailed stack traces.

Developers should regularly check these tools to ensure the application is healthy. Custom alerts can be set up in Datadog for specific metrics (e.g., high memory usage or error rates).

## 📚 GraphQL Documentation

For GraphQL APIs, you can explore and introspect the schema using:

- **GraphQL Playground**: Available at `/graphql` for development environments.
- **Apollo Studio**: For advanced schema tracking and insights in production.

Ensure to update the schema as new GraphQL queries or mutations are added to the app.

## 🛠️ Core Helper Methods

- `getRedirectUrl`: Determines where to redirect users after successful authentication. By default, it redirects to `/dashboard` but can be customized based on application routing.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are managed securely, and tokens are stored with encryption when necessary.

## 🧪 Unit & E2E Testing

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and end-to-end tests:

- **Unit Testing**: Write tests for each service and controller using Jest.
- **E2E Testing**: End-to-end tests are configured with Cypress or TestCafe to ensure entire workflows function correctly.

Run tests with:
```bash
pnpm run test
pnpm run test:e2e
```

Ensure new features are accompanied by tests to maintain reliability and prevent regressions.

## 🏗️ Job Queue Configuration (BullMQ)

BullMQ is used to manage background job processing. To configure it:

1. Ensure Redis is running.
2. Add job handlers in the appropriate services.
3. Monitor the queue with tools like Bull Board for real-time job status.

BullMQ is already configured for:
- Sending notifications.
- Batch processing Shopify orders.
- Regular cache updates.

Configure job prioritization and retry policies as needed.

## 📦 Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. Apply secrets:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets.yaml
   ```

2. Deploy Redis and the application:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/redis-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

3. Set up auto-scaling:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/hpa.yaml
   ```
